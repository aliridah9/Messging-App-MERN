# Messging-App-MERN
I build a messaging app using  the MERN framework. The back end is hosted in Heroku, and the front-end site is hosted  in Firebase. Material-UI provides the icons in the project. Pusher is used since MongoDB is not  a real-time database like Firebase and a chat application requires real-time data. It is a  functional chat application with Google authentication so that different users can log  in with their Google accounts to chat.
